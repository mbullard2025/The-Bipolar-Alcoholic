Nature of the Three-Headed Beast</h2>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 4: The
Nature of the Three-Headed Beast</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We call it that
because it is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Three heads.
One monster.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Each with its own
voice, its own hunger, its own lies. But they move as one—tearing
through your life, your peace, your sanity—unless you learn to name
them, and claim your power back.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The first head is
<b>Alcoholism</b>.<br/>
It doesn’t always roar. Sometimes it
whispers:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>You’ve
earned this.”</i><br/>
<i>“Just tonight.”</i><br/>
<i>“You're
more fun when you drink.”</i><br/>
<i>“You’re not an alcoholic,
you’re just broken.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It lies so well
we believe it’s truth. It tells us we drink because we’re
hurting. And we are. But the drink doesn’t fix the pain—it just
sedates the messenger and lets the wound fester.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We drank to
silence bipolar swings, to forget trauma, to find courage in rooms
that made us want to disappear. But alcohol is a liar. It gave us
five minutes of peace and five days of hell. It made the other two
heads stronger.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape2" height="2" name="Shape2" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The second head
is <b>Bipolar Disorder</b> (or manic depression).<br/>
It doesn’t
speak in words. It speaks in <b>voltage</b>.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It says nothing
for days, then screams <i>“You’re a god!”</i><br/>
It says
<i>“Sleep is a waste of time!”</i><br/>
It says <i>“Text your
ex at 2am. You’re healed now. Buy a truck. Book a flight. Shave
your head. Start a business. You’ve cracked the code of life!”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It doesn’t care
about your sobriety, your relationships, or your body.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then the
crash comes. The third day in bed. The unpaid bills. The regrets. The
hollow feeling like your soul fell out. That’s when bipolar
whispers another lie:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>This is who
you really are.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But that’s a
lie, too. Depression is not your truth. Mania is not your identity.
They are <b>storms</b>, not definitions. Your job is not to fight the
weather—just to learn how to prepare and endure.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape3" height="2" name="Shape3" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The third head is
<b>PTSD</b>.<br/>
Trauma.<br/>
The ghost that doesn’t leave. The
movie that plays without your permission.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Sometimes it hits
like a freight train—a smell, a sound, a memory you didn’t ask
for—and suddenly you’re not here anymore. You’re back <i>there</i>.<br/>
It
freezes you. Makes you panic. Makes you angry at things that don’t
deserve it. It says:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>You’re
not safe.”</i><br/>
<i>“No one can be trusted.”</i><br/>
<i>“This
is going to happen again.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It doesn’t
matter if the war ended years ago, or if the hands that hurt you are
long gone. Trauma doesn’t tell time.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And when PTSD is
screaming, bipolar is sparking, and alcohol is whispering all at
once?</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>That’s the
Three-Headed Beast.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And yet here’s
the truth:<br/>
You are not the beast.<br/>
You are not possessed,
broken, or doomed.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are the one
<b>being hunted</b>, and you are learning how to fight back—with
truth, with tools, with honesty, with fellowship, and with a Power
greater than yourself.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape4" height="2" name="Shape4" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Spotting the
Heads</b><br/>
The first step in fighting a monster is recognizing
when it’s speaking.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If it says,
	“One drink won’t hurt,” → <i>Alcoholism is talking.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you feel
	invincible, hyper, genius, impulsive, or wired → <i>Mania is
	rising.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you feel
	dread, detachment, numbness, or reliving the past → <i>PTSD has
	taken the wheel.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you’re
	ashamed, confused, or overwhelmed → <i>They may be working
	together.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s not your
fault.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But it is your
responsibility to <i>respond</i>. Not perfectly—just honestly.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You don’t fight
the Beast alone. You don’t have to scream back at it. You <b>call
in help</b>. You <b>speak the truth</b>. You <b>slow down</b>. You
<b>surrender</b>.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape5" height="2" name="Shape5" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>And here’s
the miracle:</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you name the
beast, it starts to shrink.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you tell
someone about it, it starts to lose power.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you let God
stand between you and it, it can’t touch your soul anymore.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You can live with
the beast outside your skin—not inside your mind.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not
crazy.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not weak.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are learning
how to survive a monster no one else can see—and that, friend,
makes you a warrior.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape6" height="2" name="Shape6" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
