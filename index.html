    <p>Welcome to the Manic PTSD Guide. This site collects the stories and insights of those living with bipolar disorder and PTSD through the lens of recovery. Even the Doctor’s Opinion in Alcoholics Anonymous’ original Big Book recognizes “the manic‑depressive type, who is perhaps the least understood by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written.” Our guide aims to be that chapter—offering understanding, solidarity and practical advice for those navigating manic and depressive extremes alongside addiction.</p>
