What We Tried Before</h2>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 3:
What We Tried Before</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Before we
surrendered, we tried everything else.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of it looked
like strength. Some of it looked like rebellion. Some of it damn near
killed us.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried to
outrun the pain. Some of us moved cities. Changed names. Deleted
phone numbers. Switched schools or jobs like outfits. We thought, <i>If
I just start over, I won’t be haunted anymore.</i> But trauma isn’t
rooted in geography. And the bipolar didn’t need a map.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried to play
God. We made rules for the world. People had to act exactly how we
needed. They had to fix our broken parts by loving us harder, staying
longer, or not leaving at all. When they failed, we punished them. Or
we punished ourselves. Usually both.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried
medications—and then we flushed them. We swore off meds like we
swore off booze: with bravado and good intentions. “I don’t want
to feel numb,” we said, while secretly praying for <i>any</i>
relief from the screaming inside. The crash always came. Harder every
time.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us made
<b>religion</b> our cage. Others made it our drug. We went to war
with God, or turned Him into a vending machine. <i>If I just pray
more. If I repent harder. If I go to church every Sunday.</i> But
religion can’t fix what we won’t face. It can’t sober us up. It
can’t diagnose bipolar disorder. And it can’t hold us through
night sweats and flashbacks unless we let it all the way in.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us slept
our way into validation. Others fought, stole, vanished, cut
ourselves, made art, joined the military, or started companies to
outrun our own emptiness. We tried to <b>perform normal</b>. We wore
masks so long we forgot our own faces.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then, of
course, we drank.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We drank to turn
the dial down on our brains. Or up. We drank to feel invincible when
depression was winning. We drank to feel numb when mania was
embarrassing. We drank because we didn’t know what else to do with
the rage, the shame, the memories, the need.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us tried
dying.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us didn’t
mean to.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us meant
to but failed—thank God.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then one day,
the hustle stopped working. The mask cracked. The bottle emptied. The
voice inside said: <i>I can’t do this anymore.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That voice is
sacred.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s the
moment we came in through the doors. Or back through them.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s the
moment we realized we weren’t bad. We weren’t crazy. We were
<i>sick</i>. And we needed help. Real help. Not judgment. Not more
promises we couldn’t keep. Not pills without connection or therapy
without faith or meetings without honesty.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We needed
<b>everything</b>.<br/>
We needed a <b>program for the whole self</b>—not
just the drunk part.<br/>
A place where we could say:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I am an
	alcoholic.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I have
	bipolar disorder.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I’ve
	seen things no one should see.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I’m not
	sure I want to live.”<br/>
And not be thrown out.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We needed to hear
someone else say:<br/>
<b>“Me too. And I’m still here.”</b></p>    </article>
