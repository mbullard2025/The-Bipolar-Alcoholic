<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">
<b>Chapter 1: A Letter to the Reader</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you picked
this book up, you might already feel like you’re drowning.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Maybe you’ve
got a bottle close. Maybe you’re still shaking from something you
can’t name. Maybe you’ve been up for three nights, scribbling
genius on napkins, and now your hands won’t stop trembling.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Or maybe, just
maybe, you’re sitting still for the first time in weeks. And you
don’t know whether to scream, cry, or disappear entirely.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not
alone. Not even close.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">There are many of
us—those who were told our minds were broken, our memories too
jagged to make peace with, our lives beyond repair. We carry <b>manic
fire</b>, <b>the slow freeze of depression</b>, the <b>phantoms of
trauma</b>, and the <b>bitter sting of addiction</b>. We have crawled
through days soaked in shame, rage, ecstasy, numbness—and many of
us did it with a drink in our hand, trying to quiet the noise.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us came
to AA and felt out of place. The Steps made sense… until the ghosts
rose up again, or the mania returned and said, <i>You’re cured,
king</i>. Some of us tried medication but thought that meant we
couldn’t be spiritual. Some tried Jesus, others tried suicide.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And here we are.
Still.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">This book is not
about fixing you. You are not broken in the way the world thinks. You
were made to survive storms other people can't imagine. And that
survival gave you gifts—intuition, depth, compassion, and yes,
pain.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">This book is
about <b>finding a way to live</b>, not just endure. A way to build a
life worth staying for, even when your brain and your past both try
to push you off the edge.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We use the
language of AA because it works. We use <b>God</b> because we have
to—but you get to define what that means. We use honesty because
it’s the only thing that cuts through the madness.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">So stay. Just a
little longer. Read the next page. Let us tell you who we are, and
who you might become—not in some fantasy of normalcy, but in the
deep, gritty, holy work of real healing.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You're not crazy.
You’re not weak. You’re not evil.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You’re just
human. One of us.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And we’ve been
waiting for you.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 2: Our
Stories – Broken, Brave, and Still Breathing</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We came from
every corner. Cities. Country roads. Suburbs that smiled on the
outside. Trauma doesn’t discriminate—and neither does madness or
alcohol. Some of us were raised by drunks. Some were the drunk. Some
were the golden child until the first panic attack or the first manic
blowout. Some of us lost everything. Some of us didn’t have much to
begin with.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But all of us
carried something <b>we couldn’t seem to put down.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Janice</i>,
it was the night her combat boots hit American soil and the silence
got louder than the bombs ever were. She drank to stop the
flashbacks. Then drank to stop the guilt. Then drank because her body
knew no other way to feel anything.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Miguel</i>,
it was the mania. God, it felt good. He was ten feet tall, speaking
three languages, flirting with cashiers, fixing everyone’s life,
building businesses in his head. Until the crash. Until the bathtub.
Until the months in bed. And the bottle he needed to slow the high,
then numb the low.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Me</i>,
well—I had no name left by the time I showed up. Just the outline
of a person. I had climbed mountains in my head, fought dragons only
I could see, and then found myself weeping in a parking lot with a
gun in my mouth and whiskey in my lap. I didn’t want to die. I just
wanted the spinning to stop.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tell you this
not for pity, not for drama, but because <i>we speak each other's
language</i>. What doesn’t make sense to the average person <i>makes
perfect sense here</i>. The detachment. The explosions. The holy
highs and the choking lows. The silence in our rooms. The scream in
our heads.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We are not
ashamed to say it anymore:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We are
	alcoholics.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We have
	mental illness.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We have
	trauma.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We are
	spiritual beings in broken bodies learning to live again.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some say AA is
for drinkers. But the Big Book never said anything about your past
having to be neat or your mind having to be quiet. It only said you
had to be <b>willing</b>. Not perfect. Just willing.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And so we share
our stories—not to impress, but to express. To let someone else
know:<br/>
<b>You are not crazy. You are not weak. You are not the
only one.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We are walking
this with you.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape1" height="2" name="Shape1" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>A Meditation
for the Morning After a Breakdown</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">God,<br/>
I don’t
know what the hell just happened.<br/>
Maybe I yelled. Maybe I cried.
Maybe I lied. Maybe I ran.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But here I am,
still here.<br/>
Still breathing, even if it hurts.<br/>
Still sober,
or trying to be.<br/>
Still willing, even with shaking hands.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">I give you the
mess. I give you the pain. I give you my spinning brain.<br/>
I don’t
know how to fix me, but I know I can’t drink.<br/>
I don’t know
how to be still, but I know I don’t want to die.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Stay close
today.<br/>
Whisper louder than the shame.<br/>
I can’t do this
alone—<br/>
And maybe I don’t have to.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Amen.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 3:
What We Tried Before</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Before we
surrendered, we tried everything else.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of it looked
like strength. Some of it looked like rebellion. Some of it damn near
killed us.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried to
outrun the pain. Some of us moved cities. Changed names. Deleted
phone numbers. Switched schools or jobs like outfits. We thought, <i>If
I just start over, I won’t be haunted anymore.</i> But trauma isn’t
rooted in geography. And the bipolar didn’t need a map.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried to play
God. We made rules for the world. People had to act exactly how we
needed. They had to fix our broken parts by loving us harder, staying
longer, or not leaving at all. When they failed, we punished them. Or
we punished ourselves. Usually both.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tried
medications—and then we flushed them. We swore off meds like we
swore off booze: with bravado and good intentions. “I don’t want
to feel numb,” we said, while secretly praying for <i>any</i>
relief from the screaming inside. The crash always came. Harder every
time.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us made
<b>religion</b> our cage. Others made it our drug. We went to war
with God, or turned Him into a vending machine. <i>If I just pray
more. If I repent harder. If I go to church every Sunday.</i> But
religion can’t fix what we won’t face. It can’t sober us up. It
can’t diagnose bipolar disorder. And it can’t hold us through
night sweats and flashbacks unless we let it all the way in.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us slept
our way into validation. Others fought, stole, vanished, cut
ourselves, made art, joined the military, or started companies to
outrun our own emptiness. We tried to <b>perform normal</b>. We wore
masks so long we forgot our own faces.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then, of
course, we drank.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We drank to turn
the dial down on our brains. Or up. We drank to feel invincible when
depression was winning. We drank to feel numb when mania was
embarrassing. We drank because we didn’t know what else to do with
the rage, the shame, the memories, the need.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us tried
dying.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us didn’t
mean to.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us meant
to but failed—thank God.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then one day,
the hustle stopped working. The mask cracked. The bottle emptied. The
voice inside said: <i>I can’t do this anymore.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That voice is
sacred.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s the
moment we came in through the doors. Or back through them.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s the
moment we realized we weren’t bad. We weren’t crazy. We were
<i>sick</i>. And we needed help. Real help. Not judgment. Not more
promises we couldn’t keep. Not pills without connection or therapy
without faith or meetings without honesty.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We needed
<b>everything</b>.<br/>
We needed a <b>program for the whole self</b>—not
just the drunk part.<br/>
A place where we could say:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I am an
	alcoholic.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I have
	bipolar disorder.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I’ve
	seen things no one should see.”</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“I’m not
	sure I want to live.”<br/>
And not be thrown out.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We needed to hear
someone else say:<br/>
<b>“Me too. And I’m still here.”</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 4: The
Nature of the Three-Headed Beast</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We call it that
because it is exactly what it sounds like.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Three heads.
One monster.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Each with its own
voice, its own hunger, its own lies. But they move as one—tearing
through your life, your peace, your sanity—unless you learn to name
them, and claim your power back.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The first head is
<b>Alcoholism</b>.<br/>
It doesn’t always roar. Sometimes it
whispers:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>You’ve
earned this.”</i><br/>
<i>“Just tonight.”</i><br/>
<i>“You're
more fun when you drink.”</i><br/>
<i>“You’re not an alcoholic,
you’re just broken.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It lies so well
we believe it’s truth. It tells us we drink because we’re
hurting. And we are. But the drink doesn’t fix the pain—it just
sedates the messenger and lets the wound fester.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We drank to
silence bipolar swings, to forget trauma, to find courage in rooms
that made us want to disappear. But alcohol is a liar. It gave us
five minutes of peace and five days of hell. It made the other two
heads stronger.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape2" height="2" name="Shape2" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The second head
is <b>Bipolar Disorder</b> (or manic depression).<br/>
It doesn’t
speak in words. It speaks in <b>voltage</b>.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It says nothing
for days, then screams <i>“You’re a god!”</i><br/>
It says
<i>“Sleep is a waste of time!”</i><br/>
It says <i>“Text your
ex at 2am. You’re healed now. Buy a truck. Book a flight. Shave
your head. Start a business. You’ve cracked the code of life!”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It doesn’t care
about your sobriety, your relationships, or your body.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And then the
crash comes. The third day in bed. The unpaid bills. The regrets. The
hollow feeling like your soul fell out. That’s when bipolar
whispers another lie:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>This is who
you really are.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But that’s a
lie, too. Depression is not your truth. Mania is not your identity.
They are <b>storms</b>, not definitions. Your job is not to fight the
weather—just to learn how to prepare and endure.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape3" height="2" name="Shape3" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">The third head is
<b>PTSD</b>.<br/>
Trauma.<br/>
The ghost that doesn’t leave. The
movie that plays without your permission.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Sometimes it hits
like a freight train—a smell, a sound, a memory you didn’t ask
for—and suddenly you’re not here anymore. You’re back <i>there</i>.<br/>
It
freezes you. Makes you panic. Makes you angry at things that don’t
deserve it. It says:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">“<i>You’re
not safe.”</i><br/>
<i>“No one can be trusted.”</i><br/>
<i>“This
is going to happen again.”</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">It doesn’t
matter if the war ended years ago, or if the hands that hurt you are
long gone. Trauma doesn’t tell time.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And when PTSD is
screaming, bipolar is sparking, and alcohol is whispering all at
once?</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>That’s the
Three-Headed Beast.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And yet here’s
the truth:<br/>
You are not the beast.<br/>
You are not possessed,
broken, or doomed.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are the one
<b>being hunted</b>, and you are learning how to fight back—with
truth, with tools, with honesty, with fellowship, and with a Power
greater than yourself.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape4" height="2" name="Shape4" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Spotting the
Heads</b><br/>
The first step in fighting a monster is recognizing
when it’s speaking.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If it says,
	“One drink won’t hurt,” → <i>Alcoholism is talking.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you feel
	invincible, hyper, genius, impulsive, or wired → <i>Mania is
	rising.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you feel
	dread, detachment, numbness, or reliving the past → <i>PTSD has
	taken the wheel.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you’re
	ashamed, confused, or overwhelmed → <i>They may be working
	together.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">That’s not your
fault.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But it is your
responsibility to <i>respond</i>. Not perfectly—just honestly.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You don’t fight
the Beast alone. You don’t have to scream back at it. You <b>call
in help</b>. You <b>speak the truth</b>. You <b>slow down</b>. You
<b>surrender</b>.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape5" height="2" name="Shape5" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>And here’s
the miracle:</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you name the
beast, it starts to shrink.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you tell
someone about it, it starts to lose power.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">When you let God
stand between you and it, it can’t touch your soul anymore.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You can live with
the beast outside your skin—not inside your mind.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not
crazy.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not weak.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are learning
how to survive a monster no one else can see—and that, friend,
makes you a warrior.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape6" height="2" name="Shape6" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
