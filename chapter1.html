<b>Chapter 1: A Letter to the Reader</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">If you picked
this book up, you might already feel like you’re drowning.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Maybe you’ve
got a bottle close. Maybe you’re still shaking from something you
can’t name. Maybe you’ve been up for three nights, scribbling
genius on napkins, and now your hands won’t stop trembling.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Or maybe, just
maybe, you’re sitting still for the first time in weeks. And you
don’t know whether to scream, cry, or disappear entirely.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You are not
alone. Not even close.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">There are many of
us—those who were told our minds were broken, our memories too
jagged to make peace with, our lives beyond repair. We carry <b>manic
fire</b>, <b>the slow freeze of depression</b>, the <b>phantoms of
trauma</b>, and the <b>bitter sting of addiction</b>. We have crawled
through days soaked in shame, rage, ecstasy, numbness—and many of
us did it with a drink in our hand, trying to quiet the noise.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some of us came
to AA and felt out of place. The Steps made sense… until the ghosts
rose up again, or the mania returned and said, <i>You’re cured,
king</i>. Some of us tried medication but thought that meant we
couldn’t be spiritual. Some tried Jesus, others tried suicide.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And here we are.
Still.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">This book is not
about fixing you. You are not broken in the way the world thinks. You
were made to survive storms other people can't imagine. And that
survival gave you gifts—intuition, depth, compassion, and yes,
pain.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">This book is
about <b>finding a way to live</b>, not just endure. A way to build a
life worth staying for, even when your brain and your past both try
to push you off the edge.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We use the
language of AA because it works. We use <b>God</b> because we have
to—but you get to define what that means. We use honesty because
it’s the only thing that cuts through the madness.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">So stay. Just a
little longer. Read the next page. Let us tell you who we are, and
who you might become—not in some fantasy of normalcy, but in the
deep, gritty, holy work of real healing.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You're not crazy.
You’re not weak. You’re not evil.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">You’re just
human. One of us.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And we’ve been
waiting for you.</p>    </article>
