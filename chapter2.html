Stories – Broken, Brave, and Still Breathing</h2>
<p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>Chapter 2: Our
Stories – Broken, Brave, and Still Breathing</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We came from
every corner. Cities. Country roads. Suburbs that smiled on the
outside. Trauma doesn’t discriminate—and neither does madness or
alcohol. Some of us were raised by drunks. Some were the drunk. Some
were the golden child until the first panic attack or the first manic
blowout. Some of us lost everything. Some of us didn’t have much to
begin with.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But all of us
carried something <b>we couldn’t seem to put down.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Janice</i>,
it was the night her combat boots hit American soil and the silence
got louder than the bombs ever were. She drank to stop the
flashbacks. Then drank to stop the guilt. Then drank because her body
knew no other way to feel anything.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Miguel</i>,
it was the mania. God, it felt good. He was ten feet tall, speaking
three languages, flirting with cashiers, fixing everyone’s life,
building businesses in his head. Until the crash. Until the bathtub.
Until the months in bed. And the bottle he needed to slow the high,
then numb the low.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">For <i>Me</i>,
well—I had no name left by the time I showed up. Just the outline
of a person. I had climbed mountains in my head, fought dragons only
I could see, and then found myself weeping in a parking lot with a
gun in my mouth and whiskey in my lap. I didn’t want to die. I just
wanted the spinning to stop.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We tell you this
not for pity, not for drama, but because <i>we speak each other's
language</i>. What doesn’t make sense to the average person <i>makes
perfect sense here</i>. The detachment. The explosions. The holy
highs and the choking lows. The silence in our rooms. The scream in
our heads.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We are not
ashamed to say it anymore:</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We are
	alcoholics.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We have
	mental illness.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We have
	trauma.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><i>We are
	spiritual beings in broken bodies learning to live again.</i></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Some say AA is
for drinkers. But the Big Book never said anything about your past
having to be neat or your mind having to be quiet. It only said you
had to be <b>willing</b>. Not perfect. Just willing.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">And so we share
our stories—not to impress, but to express. To let someone else
know:<br/>
<b>You are not crazy. You are not weak. You are not the
only one.</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">We are walking
this with you.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><img align="bottom" alt="Shape1" height="2" name="Shape1" src="AA%20Manic%20PTSD%20guide_html_a395f82c.gif" width="624"/>
</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in"><b>A Meditation
for the Morning After a Breakdown</b></p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">God,<br/>
I don’t
know what the hell just happened.<br/>
Maybe I yelled. Maybe I cried.
Maybe I lied. Maybe I ran.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">But here I am,
still here.<br/>
Still breathing, even if it hurts.<br/>
Still sober,
or trying to be.<br/>
Still willing, even with shaking hands.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">I give you the
mess. I give you the pain. I give you my spinning brain.<br/>
I don’t
know how to fix me, but I know I can’t drink.<br/>
I don’t know
how to be still, but I know I don’t want to die.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Stay close
today.<br/>
Whisper louder than the shame.<br/>
I can’t do this
alone—<br/>
And maybe I don’t have to.</p><p style="line-height: 116%; margin-bottom: 0.11in">Amen.</p>    </article>
